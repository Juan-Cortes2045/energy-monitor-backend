/**
 * The HTTP security rules for the Security API.
 *
 * <p>The shape is a stateless bearer-token API:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>No HTTP session is ever created, so nothing about a caller is kept server side and
 *       the API scales horizontally without sticky sessions.</li>
 *   <li>CSRF protection is off, which is correct precisely because there is no session and no
 *       cookie for a cross-site request to ride on. The refresh token is currently returned in
 *       the login response body and is meant to be sent back in a header, not attached
 *       automatically by the browser, so no ambient credential exists for a cross-site request
 *       to exploit. This reasoning is contingent: it stops being true if the refresh token
 *       moves into an ambient cookie, which is one of the reasons that decision is deferred to
 *       the refresh flow. At that point CSRF protection must be re-enabled for the refresh
 *       endpoint.</li>
 *   <li>Form login and HTTP Basic are off, so the only way in is a bearer token.</li>
 *   <li>JWT signature, issuer and expiry are validated by the resource server filter before a
 *       request reaches any controller.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Everything else is denied by default: a new endpoint is protected unless it is added to
 * the permit list on purpose.
 *
 * <h2>CORS</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code cors(Customizer.withDefaults())} below resolves to the
 * {@code CorsConfigurationSource} bean published by {@link SecurityCorsConfiguration}. That bean
 * exists, so this is a real policy rather than the same-origin fallback Spring Security would
 * otherwise substitute: the server emits CORS headers for the origins the deployment names and
 * for no others.
 *
 * <p>It matters to the React web frontend, which is served from a different origin and would
 * otherwise be blocked by the browser. It does not affect React Native, because CORS is a browser
 * enforcement mechanism and a native HTTP client never applies it.
 *
 * <p>Which origins are allowed, whether credentials may ride along and why no wildcard exists
 * are argued in {@link SecurityCorsConfiguration}. The short version: the origins come from
 * configuration, they default to none, and credentials are off.

    /**
     * Paths reachable without a token. Registration and login have no caller to authenticate,
     * completing a password reset is done with a reset token rather than a session, and refresh
     * is what a client calls precisely when its access token is no longer usable.
     *
     * <p><strong>What "reachable without a token" means.</strong> These paths are exempt from
     * requiring authentication; they are not exempt from authentication being validated. The
     * resource server filter still inspects an {@code Authorization: Bearer} header on any
     * request, including these, and refuses the request with 401 when that token is malformed,
     * expired or signed with another key. A client calling {@code /api/v1/auth/refresh} must
     * therefore send the refresh token on its own and omit the stale access token, which is the
     * shape the endpoint is designed for anyway.
     *
     * <p>The alternative, resolving the bearer token to empty for these paths so a stale header
     * would be ignored, is deliberately not implemented. It would mean treating an invalid
     * credential as acceptable on every public route, which is a much wider relaxation than
     * one endpoint needs, and there is no architectural requirement behind it: the refresh
     * secret is the authority for that call, and the client is told to present only it.
