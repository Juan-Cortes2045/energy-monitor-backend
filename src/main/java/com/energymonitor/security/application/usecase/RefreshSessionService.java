/**
 * Rotates a refresh token, and treats a replay of a retired one as a security incident.
 *
 * <h2>The exchange</h2>
 *
 * <p>A refresh token is good for exactly one exchange. Presenting an active one retires it and
 * mints its successor in the same family, against the same session. The session is not replaced
 * and no second one is created: rotating a secret is not a new login, so the session keeps its
 * identity and its original creation instant and only slides its expiry.
 *
 * <p>Issuing the replacement access token is deliberately not done here. That belongs to the
 * delivery layer, which is the only place that knows the transport, so this use case concerns
 * itself with the credential chain and reports whether the exchange succeeded.
 *
 * <h2>Why a replay is an incident and not a bad request</h2>
 *
 * <p>A retired token is a genuine secret that has already been spent. Seeing it again means one
 * of two things, and the system cannot tell which: the legitimate client is retrying a request
 * it already had accepted, or somebody kept a copy and is using it now. The safe reading of an
 * ambiguity like that is that the credential leaked, so the entire family is revoked and the
 * session is marked compromised. The legitimate client, if that is who it was, logs in again;
 * an attacker holding one stolen token gets nothing.
 *
 * <p>Answering a replay as a plain rejection would leave the thief and the real user in exactly
 * the same position and would mean the theft was never noticed.
 *
 * <p>Expired and revoked tokens are treated differently on purpose. A client that was merely
 * slow is not a security event, and escalating it would revoke the family every time somebody's
 * clock was wrong.
