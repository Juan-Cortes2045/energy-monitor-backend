/**
 * SHA-256 implementation of {@link RefreshTokenHasherPort} and
 * {@link PasswordResetTokenHasherPort}.
 *
 * <p>One adapter serves both ports because the two credentials are the same kind of thing: a
 * 32-byte secret from {@link java.security.SecureRandom} whose hash is the only part worth
 * storing. What differs is which aggregate holds the result, not how the digest is computed, so
 * one implementation is not a shortcut but the honest description of the capability.
 *
 * <h2>Why SHA-256 and not BCrypt</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same codebase uses BCrypt for passwords, and reusing it here would look consistent
 * while being the wrong tool. BCrypt exists to make brute force expensive against a
 * <em>low-entropy</em> secret that a human chose and can be guessed from a dictionary. A refresh
 * token or a password-reset token here is 32 bytes from {@link java.security.SecureRandom}:
 * roughly 2^256 candidates, none of which any list covers. There is nothing for a slow KDF to
 * slow down, and a deliberate cost factor would only add latency to every single refresh.
 *
 * <p>SHA-256 is therefore the appropriate primitive, and the cost it does add is irrelevant
 * because lookups are bounded by how often a client refreshes rather than by how often an
 * attacker guesses: an attacker cannot brute force a hash they have to fetch over the network.
 *
 * <h2>Representation</h2>
 *
 * <p>Lowercase hexadecimal, 64 characters for the 32-byte digest, matching
 * {@code refresh_token.token_hash VARCHAR(64)} and
 * {@code password_reset_token.reset_token_hash VARCHAR(64)}.
 *
 * <p>Hex was chosen over Base64 for three reasons. It is the representation that survives the
 * most contexts unchanged, so a hash can be copied into a log, a support ticket or a manual
 * query without escaping. It is fixed width, so the column length is not a guess. And it is
 * emitted in a single case, which matters because the schema compares case-insensitively: a
 * Base64 hash could in principle collide with a differently-cased twin of itself, while a
 * lower-case hex string has only one spelling.
