/**
 * Which context a notification belongs to.
 *
 * <p>This is not the same question as what the message says.
 * An alert and the message about an alert are related, but they are not the same fact, and the
 * documented model keeps them apart: {@code sourceType} plus {@code sourceId} locate the row this
 * message is about, while {@code messageKey} names the wording that was used.
 *
 * <p>Those two facts can disagree, and are meant to. A message about an alert can be worded as
 * "your alert" or as "we noticed something"; the source says what it refers to and the key says how
 * it was phrased. Collapsing them would force a wording change to be a data migration.
 *
 * <p>{@link #SECURITY} exists because recovery codes are sent by this module on behalf of another
 * one: the source row lives in the security module and is referenced by identifier, with no foreign
 * key, which is what keeps the two independent.
