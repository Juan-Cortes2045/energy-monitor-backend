/**
 * Closes delivery records that a previous run opened and never finished.
 *
 * <p>When a process dies with mail in flight, the record for that delivery stays {@code PENDING}
 * forever, claiming a send that will never happen. This closes those rows as failed, so the log
 * tells the truth about what went out.
 *
 * <p><strong>It does not resend anything, and the reason is not caution.</strong> Reconstructing the
 * message would mean this module generating a recovery code, which is the security module's job and
 * its secret: the code is hashed there, stored there and bound to an account there. A retry here
 * could only send a code this module invented, which no stored hash would match, or resend a code
 * nobody still holds. Both would be worse than an honest failure, because the first would look
 * delivered and the second would deliver a secret that is no longer redeemable. So the sweep
 * records the failure and stops.
 *
 * <p>The threshold is generous compared with any real SMTP conversation, so a slow send is not
 * mistaken for a dead one; the residue is that a genuinely stuck row stays {@code PENDING} for that
 * long before anyone learns it was.
